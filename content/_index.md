# Introduction
Welcome, Comrades, to the SovietLinux documentation!

SovietLinux is an independent, proletarian, rolling release Linux distribution, forged from scratch by the hands of the working class.

SovietLinux is developed in the spare time of a dedicated cadre of developers, its not ready for daily-driving yet but we are close. We labor out of passion and hope that our collective work will serve the greater good of all comrades.
